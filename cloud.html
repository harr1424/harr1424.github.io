        <h1>What is an API? What are containers?</h1>
        <p>
            Generally speaking, an API is a software intermediary that allows two applications to talk to each other.
            For example, if you are using your phone and want to access a YouTube video your phone will communicate with
            the YouTube servers using an intermediary API that takes your phone’s request, retrieves the data from
            YouTube’s servers, and returns it to your device.
            An API also adds a layer of security by ensuring that the two devices only access each other through a
            predefined intermediary. However, APIs can actually be security flaws if the access to the API is not
            properly controlled and have been for websites such as Facebook.
            Modern APIs often rely on standards (such as HTTP or REST) which are friendly to developers and widely
            understood.
        </p>
        <p>
            The functional unit of an API is known as an <i>endpoint</i>. Endpoints can be implemented to perform specific
            functions. Imagine an API that is contacted in order to retrieve up-to-date weather information.
            One endpoint may return jSON data describing a weather forecast and another endpoint may return current weather
            information. Most APIs are contacted via the public internet, and in such cases the API is accessed
            at it's <i>base url</i>. For example, the United States National Weather Service provides a free and
            public API providing weather information at the base address <a href="https://api.weather.gov">https://api.weather.gov</a>.
            Navigating to this link in a web browser or requesting the page via cURL or similar command line tool will
            return a message informing the API consumer of the APIs status. Specific endpoints can be accessed by
            appending to the <i>base url</i>. For example, <a href="https://api.weather.gov/alerts">https://api.weather.gov/alerts</a>
             returns a list of all current weather alerts in the United States.
        </p>
        <p>
            Frequently, APIs
            are run in <a href="https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container/">Docker containers</a> which allows them to
            be highly portable (able to operate on a wide variety of infrastructure across various operating systems) and
            also highly efficient (operate on as little computing resources as possible). A developer is able to write
            a recipe describing a particular container using a <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/">dockerfile</a>.
            The example below demonstrates the specification necessary to run an API accessing Amazon Web Services (AWS)
            resources. This dockerfile will be used to house the API examined in depth on this page:

                <code>
FROM python:3.8-slim-buster

ENV AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-west-2
ENV AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="REDACTED"
ENV AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="REDACTED"
COPY ./requirements.txt /app/requirements.txt
COPY ./main.py /app/main.py
RUN pip3 install --no-cache-dir --upgrade -r /app/requirements.txt
EXPOSE 5555

                </code>
            </pre>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-6">
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The <code>FROM</code> instruction specifies a parent image to install onto the container, in
                    this case a variant of Debian Buster that contains the minimal dependencies (slim) required to run
                    Python 3.8.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The <code>WORKDIR</code> instruction sets thr working directory for any subsequent <code>RUN</code>
                    commands
                </li>
                <li>
                    Environment variables can be specified using the <code>ENV</code> instruction. In this case, such
                    environment variables are credentials to access AWS resources and have thus been redacted
                </li>
                <li>
                    The <code>COPY</code> instruction has been used here to copy files from the local machine into the
                    container
                </li>
                <li>
                    The <code>RUN</code> instruction is used to execute a command that will install packages required
                    by the API
                </li>
                <li>
                    The <code>EXPOSE</code> instruction is used to instruct the container to listen on a specific port
                    at runtime
                </li>
                <li>
                    The <code>CMD</code> instruction specifies a command to execute once runtime begins
                </li>
