            This project involves creating a
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network"> neural network</a>
            for the purpose of classifying audio samples as expressing a predominant emotion (happy, sad, angry, etc).
            Neural networks in the context of machine learning are modeled after biological neural networks and
            function in a similar manner. Individual neurons, commonly called nodes, receive input as numerical data,
            process this data using an equation, and then output a result which can be fed as input to additional
            nodes or in the case of a terminal node can be used to make some prediction. The optimal solution I found
            for classifying audio samples in terms of emotion utilized a neural network with two
