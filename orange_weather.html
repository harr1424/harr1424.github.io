            <h3>An Important Note:</h3>
            <p>
                iOS 16 will include the Apple <a href="https://developer.apple.com/weatherkit/">Weather Kit</a> API, providing 
                additional functionality and eliminating the dependency upon a call-limited API. I plan to refactor this project 
                to utilize Weather Kit once iOS 16 is in stable release (Fall, 2022). 
            </p>

            <h3>A Brief Introduction to Swift</h3>
            <div class="col-md-g">
                <p>
                    Orange Weather allows users to view current weather conditions as well as hourly and daily forecasts
                    at their current location. Its development process provided a great opportunity to learn more about
                    Swift, SwiftUI, and how to receive API data within an iOS app. Having previously created apps
                    written in
                    Kotlin and Dart, a lot of the Swift syntax and functionality seemed familiar. All three languages
                    are
                    strongly typed, differentiate between mutable and immutable variables, and provide a means of
                    implementing
                    anonymous functions (known as <a
                        href="https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/Closures.html">closures</a>
                    in Swift). Out of the three languages mentioned above, Swift quickly became my favorite as it has
                    some
                    features that make life so much easier!
                </p>
                <p>
                    To start, I was delighted that similar to C++, Swift allows for object-oriented programming through
                    the
                    use
                    of
                    not only classes, but also structs. In Swift, both structs and classes are used to create objects
                    that
                    contain members and/or functions related in some way. Classes are able to inherit attributes from
                    other
                    classes,
                    but inheritance is not a capability among structs. Structs are also said to be immutable, meaning
                    that
                    if a
                    given struct is modified, instead of changing a variable at a location in memory allocated to the
                    struct,
                    an entirely new struct will be created with the updated variable. An example of this is below:
                </p>
            </div>

            <code>
            <pre>
            struct Cat {
                let _class = "Mammal" // _class is immutable, a spoecies can't change class
                var paws: Int
                var tail: Bool
                var color: String
            }

            var CremePuff = Cat(paws: 4, tail: true, color: "beige")
            CremePuff.paws = 3 // Creampuff will be copied and the variable paws set to 3 in the fresh copy

            let Granpa = Cat(paws: 4, tail: true, color: "unknown")
            Granpa.color = "black" // this will not compile because Granpa was defined as immutable using the let keyword
            </pre>
        </code>

            <P>
                * <code>_class</code> is prefixed with an underscore because <code>class</code> is a keyword in Swift
                <br>
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creme_Puff_(cat)">Who are CremePuff and Granpa?</a>
            </P>

            <p>
                Another very welcomed feature in Swift is the ability to <i>extend</i> types (either built-in or custom)
                through
                the use of <a href="https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/Extensions.html">extensions</a>.
                Since
                structs
                are a type, this allows us to extend the functionality of our structs in situations where this is
                desirable,
                and by using the <code>private</code> keyword, we can contain the effect this extension has within a
                single
                module.
            </p>
            <code>
            <pre>
                extension Cat {
                    func meow() {
                         print("Meow")
                        }
                    }

                Granpa.meow()
            </pre>
        </code>

            <p>
                The code above will print: <code>Meow</code>
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="pt-5"></div>

            <h3>First Impressions of SwiftUI</h3>
            <p>
                SwiftUI was released by Apple in 2019 as an updated way to build user interfaces in a declarative form.
                Apple has invested heavily in developing and promoting the adoption of SwiftUI as it provides a way to
                design
                user interfaces across all Apple devices (as opposed to selecting UIKit for iOS devices or AppKit for
                Mac
                OS X). SwiftUI contains all of the same user interface (UI) elements I became familiar with using in
                Storyboard
                layouts, such as `UIButton` and `UITableView, but provides for a different way of implementing these
                elements
                within an app.
            </p>
            <p>
                It might just be me, but it seems like declarative programming frameworks have been gaining a lot of
                momentum
                over the past several years. Android also released a declarative framework for building apps called
                <a href="https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose">Jetpack Compose</a> in 2019. Declarative
                programming
                describes a modality of programming where the desired outcome is described using code, and a compiler or
                framework is responsible for accomplishing this outcome. Imperative programming refers to a programmer
                explicitly
                specifying how to accomplish an outcome in a step-by-step process. Previously, I have used
                <a href="https://www.terraform.io/">Terraform></a> to provision cloud infrastructure, and so the
                declarative
                concept was a familiar one.
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition to providing a cross platform means of defining application layouts using a declarative
                framework,
                SwiftUI also simplifies application state management. The state of an application
                can change very rapidly, especially in apps that are performing work with data retrieved from the
                internet.
                SwiftUI abstracts away much of an application's state management, and
                this will be explored in greater detail below. Additionally, SwiftUI is
                <a href="https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/">constantly being updated</a> in order to
                provide improved access to Apple APIs.

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The entry point to the application is stored in a struct named <code>Orange_WeatherApp</code>.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        This struct is annotated with <code>@main</code> to identify it as the main view.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        This struct is used to inform the app to display <code>MainWeatherView</code> once the app is
                        initialized.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <pre>
import SwiftUI

@main
struct Orange_WeatherApp: App {
    var body: some Scene {
        WindowGroup {
            MainWeatherView()
        }
    }
}

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The <code>MainWeatherView</code> struct is the initial point of entry that a user has with the
                        app.
                        As
                        such it has been designed to respond immediately if a user is not connected to the internet or
                        if
                        they have not granted location permissions to the app. In order to perform these checks, methods
                        have been defined in two classes <code>Networking</code> and <code>NetworkStatus</code>.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <code>Networking</code> will be examined in detail below, but contains members and methods which
                        are
                        related to device location, permissions, and requesting information from the OpenWeather API.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <code>NetworkStatus</code> contains members and methods solely related to the connectivity
                        status
                        of the device.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Both instances have been annotated as <code>@StateObject</code>. SwiftUI allows structs and
                        classes
                        to publish members which can then be observed by other structs or classes. If a struct or class
                        observes an object that it instantiates, the <code>@StateObject</code> annotation should be
                        used. If
                        an
                        observable object is then later passed into another class, that referencing class should
                        annotate
                        the
                        observed object with the <code>ObservedObject</code> annotation.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Apple provides the <code>CLLocationManager</code> API that developers can use to interface with
                        a
                        device location. This API sends and receives location information using the
                        <code>CLLocationDegrees</code> data type.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The <code>update()</code> helper method is used to perform API requests anytime the UI should be
                        updated
                        to show the most recent weather data.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        In SwiftUI, a <code>View</code> is a protocol. Structs and classes are said to <i>conform</i> to
                        protocols. (Protocols are analagous to interfaces in Java and Kotlin).
                        In order for a given view to conform to the <code>View</code> protocol, it must implement a
                        variable
                        named <code>body</code> which describes the view.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The declaration <code>var body: some View { ...</code> may seem confusing at first. This
                        declaration
                        defines the <code>body</code> attribute necessary for <code>MainWeatherView</code> to conform to
                        the
                        <ciode>View</ciode>
                        protocol. But since <code>body</code> is a variable and not a class, struct, or
                        enumeration, the syntax <code>var body: some View</code> means that the variable
                        <code>body</code>
                        is <i>some</i> type of view. It could be a <code>UITextView</code>, a <code>UITableView</code>,
                        or
                        any other type of view, but declaring its type as a <code>View</code> is essential for the
                        compiler
                        operations
                        that allow SwiftUI to update UI elements so quickly.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Immediately upon the view being displayed, Orange Weather checks to see if the user device is
                        connected
                        to the internet, and if it is not, an error message will be shown to the user explaining why an
                        internet connection is required.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A similar check is performed for location-based permissions. Orange Weather requires a user's
                        location
                        in order to obtain current weather information at that location. Thus, at a minimum, a user must
                        grant permission to the app to access device location while the app is in use. The first time
                        that
                        the app
                        runs on a user device, they will be prompted with the following: <br><br>

                        <img src="images/OrangeWeather/loc.png" alt="Location permission prompt" width="400"
                            class="center">

                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If they fail to select "Allow Once" or "Allow While Using App" a view describing the problem

                        The UI content which is intended to be displayed if a device is connected to the internet and
                        permissions have been granted has been wrapped inside a <code>NavigationView</code> which
                        has several benefits:
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Each navigation screen is now given a title, and in the case of the main view, I have
                                programmatically
                                set the title to match the current device location.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Subsequent views navigated to will also be assigned titles, and a back arrow will appear
                                at the top of the screen next to the title allowing the user to easily navigate back to
                                the
                                main view.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                NavigationViews provide a lot of accessibility configuration options to make navigating
                                the

                view. This process is shown below for an <code>HourlyView</code> (below left). Once
                <code>HourlyView</code> has been defined, it is then possible to create a list of

                views

            <h3>Networking: </h3>
            <p>
                The most difficult part of creating Orange Weather involved retrieving a device's current location and
                using this location in subsequent API calls. The class examined below contains logic to accomplish this:
            </p>
            <div class="col-md-6">
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Our networking class needs to expose the results of its API calls. This is done by annotating
                        the objects that will be observed in the UI by using the <code>@Published</code> annotation.
                        Note
                        that
                        these objects have been defined in a separate file, which will be examined later. Most
                        importantly,
                        when
                        defining these objects as structs, they must conform to the <code>Observable Object</code>
                        protocol in order to be published and observed.

                    <li>
                        The overridden <code>init()</code> method is responsible for setting the location manager
                        delegate
                        property to be itself. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delegation_pattern"> The delegate
                            pattern</a>
                        is very common in iOS development, and many of Apple's APIs implement this pattern. Effectively,
                        by setting the current class as the location manager delegate, we are allowing this class to
                        respond
                        to
                        permission changes, handle errors, respond to location events, and in general, control the
                        functioning
                        of the <code>CLLocationManager</code> API instance. Also in <code>init()</code>, the desired
                        location
                        is set to an area reasonable for obtaining accurate weather data, adequate permissions are
                        requested
                        of the user, and the instance is instructed to begin updating the user's location.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        It is essential to account for the location permissions currently granted to Orange Weather by
                        the
                        user.
                        If the user has not granted adequate permissions, our API calls will not return data in the
                        expected
                        format, and if this is not handled, our app will crash. We will explore additional ways to
                        gracefully handle an unexpected API response, but only calling API endpoints once we are certain
                        that
                        a device has the correct lat lon coordinates is an important first step.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The first time a user launches Orange Weather, the location permissions granted to the app are
                        <code>.notDetermined</code>. Hopefully, the user grants permission to the app to access device
                        location
                        while the app is in use, but this will take a few moments. Once a user has decided whether or
                        not to
                        grant permissions, the <code>didChangeAuthorizations</code> method will be called, which will in
                        turn
                        update the variables in <code>Networking</code> responsible for tracking current permission
                        status.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Once the instance of <code>CLLocatinManager</code> updates the <code>lastLocation</code>
                        property
                        the
                        method <code>didUpdateLocations</code> will be called. Since our <code>Networking</code> class
                        is set
                        as the delegate for this instance, we are able to define what should happen once location has
                        been
                        updated.
                        Here, we have instructed the app to perform API calls that will update the published properties
                        that are being observed in the UI. Once this completes, we instruct
                        <code>CLLocationManager</code>
                        to
                        stop updating the device location. If we did not do this, the app would continuously update the
                        device
                        location every few seconds and perform three API calls each time, and so we would quickly exceed
                        our limited available API calls (OpenWeather limits to 60 API calls per minute at their free
                        tier).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Lastly, the three API calls are defined: <code>getMainWeather</code> loads data representing
                        current weather conditions into a published object, <code>getLocationString</code> loads a
                        string representation of the user's current location into a published object, and
                        <code>getAQI</code> does the same for the current Air Quality Index.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Each function defines a string representation of an API request. This string is used to create a
                        <code>URLSession</code> in order to send a request and process a response. This response will
                        consist
                        of JSON data, which will need to be decoded, into a series of <code>struct</code>
                        representations of
                        that
                        data. Assuming all goes well, the response will be decoded and the data will be used to update
                        the UI. Note that this last step is performed on the main thread
                        <code>DispatchQueue.main.async</code> ensuring that once this data is available, it will be
                        updated on the main thread, which is the thread devoted to UI updates.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        An identical process occurs for <code>getLocationString</code> and <code>getAQI</code>.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Next, we will examine how to define structs in order to decode the JSON response.

            <h3>Decoding JSON in Swift</h3>
            <p>
                I was delighted with the simplicity involved in decoding the JSON response in Swift. This process is
                considerably
                more straightforward than what I was accustomed to in Android, which required the use of third-party
                libraries
                such as RetroFit and Moshi. In Swift, it is sufficient to examine the API response and construct
                <code>struct</code> objects containing the properties you wish to decode. This is something I would have
                definitley taken for granted if I had not formerly used RetroFit and Moshi, which require every JSON
                response field
                to be declared inside some object. The below code demonstrates what the response returned by the API
                endpoint
                called in <code>getMainWeather</code> will look like. Note that for the sake of readability, only the
                elements contained in the <code>current</code> array have been copied. <code>hourly</code> and
                <code>daily</code> are arrays containing a large number of similarly-structured elements.

                Examining this response, we can cherry pick the elements that will be most useful for our app and create
                structs to receive these elements:

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Notice in the code for <code>getMainWeather()</code> that the <code>JSONDecoder</code> expects
                        a parameter <code>WeatherResponse.self</code>. This refers to a <code>WeatherResponse</code>
                        struct
                        that the decoder will use to map the JSON data to. The <code>self</code> keyword is necessary
                        because the <code>WeatherResponse</code> struct is referenced from within a closure. More about
                        this
                        can be found <a
                            href="https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/Closures.html#ID546">here</a>.

                    <li>
                        In this explanation, we are concerned with the JSON response contained in the
                        <code>current</code>
                        array as shown above. Our <code>WeatherResponse</code> struct has now declared properties
                        corresponding
                        to the JSON response elements we are interested in, including <code>current</code>. Next, we
                        must
                        create structs to receive the elements nested inside of the <code>current</code> array.

                            The <code>Current</code> struct has declared attributes for each field we are interested in
                            using
                            from the JSON response. Note that <code>weather</code> is of type <code>Weather</code>
                            array,
                            and
                            so we need to define one last <code>Weather</code> struct to describe an individual
                            <code>Weather</code>
                            element. The only nested element we are interested in is <code>id</code>, an integer that
                            represents
                            a weather condition (i.e. rain, clouds, sun, wind, etc.) This element will be used to
                            display
                            an icon that best represents current or forecasted weather conditions.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Lastly, it is important to note that each struct we intend to use for JSON decoding must
                            conform to the <code>Decodable</code> protocol. This makes things considerably easier, as
                            the
                            protocol handles the process of decoding JSON response data into standard library types,
                            such as
                            strings, integers, and doubles automatically.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Provided that all of our defined <code>struct</code> attributes can be ultimately mapped to
                            Standard Library types, this is all that is required. When working with custom types, it is
                            possible to define the decoding process using

                A similar procedure has been followed to define structs that will receive the other elements of the JSON
                response
                used in Orange Weather. We are almost done, lastly, we will examine some helper methods that enhance the
                user experience of this app.

                    <li>
                        One way to enhance user experience is to provide a graphic representation of weather conditions
                        either in a forecast or currently as shown on <code>MainWeatherView</code>. This is something
                        common in many weather apps.

                    <li>
                        I have done this by making use of <i>SF Symbols (San Fransisco Symbols)</i>, a collection of
                        icons Apple provides for use in developing iOS and Mac OS apps.

                    <li>
                        A switch statement is used to determine which SF Symbol to display based upon the value
                        received from the API response contained in the element <code>id</code> that we examined above.

                        The API endpoint responsible for sending information about air quality sends this information as
                        an integer value. It would be a very poor user experience to see something like: <code>
                    Current Air Quality: 5 </code> when, in fact, the air quality they are experiencing is among the worst
                        in the entire world. We can define helper methods that will allow us to programmatically give
                        the
                        user context about the current air quality.

                        <code>getAQIstring</code> will return a string representation of the current air quality, and
                        this
                        string representation will be used within a Text view to provide easy-to-understand information

                    <li>
                        Additionally, we can programmatically assign a color to the text color used in
                        <code>MainWeatherView</code>, changing text color to orange, red, and purple as the air quality
                        progressively worsens.
