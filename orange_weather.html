        <h3>Orange Weather: A brief introduction to Swift</h3>
        <p>
            Orange Weather allows users to view current weather conditions as well as hourly and daily forecasts
            at their current location. It's development process provided a great opportunity to learn more about
            Swift, SwiftUI, and how to receive API data within an iOS app. Having previously created apps written in
            Kotlin and Dart, a lot of the Swift syntax and functionality seemed familiar. All three languages are
            strongly typed, differentiate between mutable and immutable variables, and provide a means of implementing
            anonymous functions (known as <a href="https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/Closures.html">closures</a>
            in Swift). Out of the three languages mentioned above, Swift quickly became my favorite as it has some
            features that make life so much easier!
        </p>
        <p>
            To start, I was delighted that similar to C++, Swift allows for object-oriented programming through the use of
            not only classes, but also structs. In Swift, both structs and classes are used to create objects that
            contain members and/or functions related in some way. Classes are able to inherit attributes from other classes,
            but inheritance is not a capability among structs. Structs are also said to be immutable, meaning that if a
            given struct is modified, instead of changing a variable at a location in memory allocated to the struct,
            an entirely new struct will be created with the updated variable. An example of this is below:
        </p>
        <code>
            <pre>
            struct Cat {
                let _class = "Mammal" // _class is immutable, a spoecies can't change class
                var paws: Int
                var tail: Bool
                var color: String
            }

            var CremePuff = Cat(paws: 4, tail: true, color: "beige")
            CremePuff.paws = 3 // Creampuff will be copied and the variable paws set to 3 in the fresh copy

            let Granpa = Cat(paws: 4, tail: true, color: "unknown")
            Granpa.color = "black" // this will not compile because Granpa was defined as immutable using the let keyword
            </pre>
        </code>

        <P>
            * <code>_class</code> is prefixed with an underscore because <code>class</code> is a keyword in Swift
            <br>
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creme_Puff_(cat)">Who are CremePuff and Granpa?</a>
        </P>

        <p>
            Another very welcome feature in Swift is the ability to <i>extend</i> types (either built-in or custom) through
            the use of <a href="https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/Extensions.html">extensions</a>. Since structs
            are a type, this allows us to extend the functionality of our structs in situations where this is desirable,
            and by using the <code>private</code> keyword, we can contain the effect this extension has within a single
            module.
        </p>
        <code>
            <pre>
                extension Cat {
                    func meow() {
                         print("Meow")
                        }
                    }

                Granpa.meow()
            </pre>
        </code>

        <p>
            The code above will print: <code>Meow</code>
        </p>
