            <h3>Mobile Application Development</h3>
            <p>Eager to learn more about software development, and disappointed by the course offerings at UMT,
                I was fortunate to work with Patricia Duce in order to complete an Android Developer
                <a href="https://developer.android.com/courses/android-basics-kotlin/course">training course</a>
                and use the material contained therein to develop a course taught for the first time at UMT in Fall,
                2022.
                Android development has been an excellent way to get hands on practice writing clean code and
                work with software architecture patterns common to industry applications,
                especially <i>model-view-viewmodel
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93viewmodel">(MVMM)</a></i> which is
                <a href="https://developer.android.com/jetpack/guide">officially endorsed</a> as a best practice
                when building apps. According to Android: </p>
            <blockquote CITE="https://developer.android.com/jetpack/guide"><I>
                Another important principle is that you should drive your UI from data models, preferably persistent
                models.
                Data models represent the data of an app. They're independent from the UI elements and other components
                in your app. This means that they are not tied to the UI and app component lifecycle, but will still be
                destroyed when the OS decides to remove the app's process from memory.
            </I></blockquote>
            <p>
                This effectively separates the application into two layers: a user-interface (UI) layer, and
                a data layer. This concept is just one example of various design principles that I learned while
                exploring application development. While it was necessary to focus solely on Android development
                for the purposes of creating a cirriculum for future students, I was also able to explore iOS development
                using Swift and the Flutter framework.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>What I've Learned</h3>
            <p>
                While Android applications have historically been written using Java, in May, 2019 Google announced
                that the officially supported language for Android development would be
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kotlin_(programming_language)">Kotlin</a>.
                Kotlin has much in common with Java but its syntax has been changed to support type inference and
                eliminate the terminating semicolons, among many other features such as inline lambda functions,
                null safety, range expressions, and coroutines, all of which are explored in depth in the
                <a href="https://developer.android.com/courses/android-basics-kotlin/course">training course</a> that
                I completed.
            </p>
            <p>
                This course also emphaised the importance of testing application code, and each module contained an
                activity designed to teach how to write effective unit and functional tests.
                After teaching foundational concepts such as user interface (UI) management using layout resource files,
                click listeners, etc. the course demonstrated how to implement a
                <a href="https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/layout/recyclerview">Recycler View</a>.
                Recycler Views are the component inside of Android applications that allow for an infinitely scrollable list.
                Think of any 'feed' you have encountered such as news feed on LinkedIn or Twitter, and you will
                realize you have encountered a Recycler View or its equivalent many times.
                A fascinating amount of effort has gone into their development such that they provide a user-friendly
                experience by scrolling smoothly (not freezing or jerking as fresh list items are loaded into the list).
            </p>
            <p>
                THe following is a code snippet from my application <i>ListMaker</i> which demonstrates the use of a
                Recycler View, and its individual components will be elaborated upon below:
            </p>
            <pre>
                <code>
class MainAdapter(
    private val onItemClick: (MainItem) -> Unit, private val onItemLongClick: (MainItem) -> Boolean
) : ListAdapter<MainItem, MainAdapter.ViewHolder>(DiffCallback) {

    companion object DiffCallback : DiffUtil.ItemCallback<MainItem>() {
        override fun areItemsTheSame(oldItem: MainItem, newItem: MainItem): Boolean {
            return oldItem.itemName == newItem.itemName
        }

        override fun areContentsTheSame(oldItem: MainItem, newItem: MainItem): Boolean {
            return oldItem == newItem
        }

    }

    class ViewHolder(private var binding: ListItemBinding) : RecyclerView.ViewHolder(binding.root) {
        fun bind(item: MainItem) {
            binding.listItemText.text = item.itemName.toString()
        }
    }

    override fun onCreateViewHolder(parent: ViewGroup, viewType: Int): ViewHolder {
        val viewHolder = ViewHolder(
            ListItemBinding.inflate(
                LayoutInflater.from(parent.context),
                parent,
                false
            )
        )
        viewHolder.itemView.setOnClickListener {
            val position = viewHolder.adapterPosition
            onItemClick(getItem(position))
        }
        viewHolder.itemView.setOnLongClickListener {
            val position = viewHolder.adapterPosition
            onItemLongClick(getItem(position))
        }
        return viewHolder
    }

    override fun onBindViewHolder(holder: ViewHolder, position: Int) {
        holder.bind(getItem(position))
    }
}
                </code>
