        <h3>Cloud Computing</h3>
        <p>
            As part of a graduate course in cloud computing, I worked with a group to develop a container testing
            service.
            Many organizations host their web applications using containers (see below) that run on cloud
            infrastructure.
            Our group determined that a service allowing organizations to test their containerized applications in a
            simulated cloud-based production environment would be met with enthusiasm. The service we would
            implement
            would allow our clients to upload a container image to our infrastructure. Our service would then
            provision
            the necessary resources to deploy and test this container. Almost immediately, we recognized that
            providing such a service entailed exposing our infrastructure to abuse by malicious actors. For example
            it would be trivial to upload a container intended to misuse our cloud infrastructure for the purpose of
            mining cryptocurrency, or to provision web hosting services in order to facilitate illegal
            activity. We determined it would be necessary to thoroughly vet our clients and also to require them to
            register an account with us before using our service. My contribution to this project was to create an
            authentication <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microservices">microservice</a> that would be used
            to
            authenticate our clients before they could access our service.
        </p>

        <h3>What is an API? What are containers?</h3>
        <p>
            Generally speaking, an API is a software intermediary that allows two applications to talk to each
            other.
            For example, if you are using your phone and want to access a YouTube video, your phone will communicate
            with
            the YouTube servers using an intermediary API that takes your phone’s request, retrieves the data from
            YouTube’s servers and returns it to your device.
            An API also adds a layer of security by ensuring that the two devices only access each other through a
            predefined intermediary. However, APIs can actually be security flaws if the access to the API is not
            properly controlled and have been for websites such as Facebook.
            Modern APIs often rely on standards (such as HTTP or REST), which are friendly to developers and widely
            understood.
        </p>
        <p>
            The functional unit of an API is known as an <i>endpoint</i>. Endpoints can be implemented to perform
            specific
            functions. Imagine an API that is contacted in order to retrieve up-to-date weather information.
            One endpoint may return JSON data describing a weather forecast and another endpoint may return current
            weather
            information. Most APIs are contacted via the public internet, and in such cases, the API is accessed
            at its <i>base url</i>. For example, the United States National Weather Service provides a free and
            public API providing weather information at the base address <a
                href="https://api.weather.gov">https://api.weather.gov</a>.
            Navigating to this link in a web browser, or requesting the page via cURL or similar command line tool,
            will
            return a message informing the API consumer of the APIs status. Specific endpoints can be accessed by
            appending to the <i>base url</i>. For example, <a
                href="https://api.weather.gov/alerts">https://api.weather.gov/alerts</a>
            returns a list of all current weather alerts in the United States.
        </p>
        <p>
            Frequently, APIs
            are run in <a href="https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container/">Docker containers</a>, which
            allows them to
            be highly portable (able to operate on a wide variety of infrastructure across various operating
            systems) and
            also highly efficient (operate on as little computing resources as possible). A developer is able to
            write
            a recipe describing a particular container using a <a
                href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/">dockerfile</a>.
            The example below demonstrates the specification necessary to run an API accessing Amazon Web Services
            (AWS)
            resources. This dockerfile will be used to house the API examined in depth on this page:

            <h3>Developing a back-end authentication API</h3>
            <p>
                I have used <a href="https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/">FastAPI</a> to implement the back-end logic
                required
                for performing authentication. I've chosen FastAPI over competing API frameworks because I was very
                impressed
                with the documentation provided by FastAPI. Not only were the getting started tutorials on their
                website
                excellent, but within the API itself one can navigate to a built-in <code>/docs</code> endpoint and
                interact with the various endpoints contained within the API (this will be demonstrated below).
                Let's take a
                look at our API implementation; it is very straightforward:

                    <li>
                        In FastAPI endpoints are defined using the annotation pattern
                        <code>@&lt;app_name&gt;.&lt;HTTP_request_type&gt;(/"&lt;path_to_endpoint&gt;")</code>.

                    <li>
                        This means API consumers can access the endpoint by navigating to the base url followed by
                        the
                        endpoints path, i.e. <code>authenticator_api.dev/register/</code>.

                    <li>
                        The <code>register</code> endpoint uses the helper function <code>hash_new_password()</code>
                        in order to obtain a salt and hashed password provided during a registration attempt. These
                        values
                        will be stored as a DynamoDB table row where the client email serves as a primary key.

                        The <code>authenticate</code> endpoint is implemented to allow clients the convenience
                        of ensuring their registered credentials are working as expected. This endpoint expects to
                        receive
                        HTML form data from the project's front end web page (described below).

                    <li>
                        This endpoint will query the DynamoDB table for a provided email, and if this email exists,
                        the
                        corresponding salt and hashed password that were stored in the same row will be retrieved
                        and
                        will be passed to the helper function <code>is_correct_password()</code> in order to
                        determine if
                        the password provided to the form matches the previously registered password.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The <code>authenticate_no_form</code> endpoint is used to interface directly between the

                        project's API (responsible for provisioning cloud infrastructure and deploying

                        images) and expects to receive a username and password value as <code>string</code>
                        types.

                    <li>
                        Finally, a <a href="https://www.uvicorn.org/">Uvicorn</a> server is started that runs the

        <div class="row">
            <p>
                Next, a registration form needs to be created that will allow clients to register for an account
                with our
                service and provide their preferred credentials. This form is simple and consists of basic HTML and
                <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> CSS. Bootstrap is used because it provides
                convenient form classes that validate field entries before the form is submitted, and this
                eliminates edge cases where a client may submit a null username or password value. Note that the API
                has been taken offline to avoid incurring unexpected costs on AWS, and the buttons
                <code>Authenticate</code>
                and <code>Register</code> now post the form field data to a public DNS resolver, so please do not
                enter any sensitive information.

    <h3>Deploying with Docker and Amazon ECS</h3>
    <p>
        We have successfully implemented all the individual components of our microservice, and testing has
        confirmed
        that everything is working as expected. Now it is time to deploy our microservice to cloud
        infrastructure,
        where our clients and the main project API can access it via the public internet. For this, I
        decided to use
        <a href="https://docs.docker.com/cloud/ecs-integration/">Docker Compose and ECS</a>. Docker Compose
        allows
        multiple containers to be configured and also provides the ability to define components shared
        between them.
        Amazon's
        <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/">Elastic Container Service</a> (ECS) is a container
        orchestration
        service that makes it easy to deploy, manage and scale containerized applications.
        <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/">Amazon Cloud Formation</a> is similar to Terraform
        in that
        it uses a declarative file to provision cloud infrastructure. The <code>docker-compose.yml</code>
        file
        shown below will be converted into an Amazon Cloud Formation template in order to provision the
        additional
        resources needed to deploy and interface the two containers described:

                <code>x-aws-loadbalancer</code> is declared here but was provisioned manually via the AWS
                console. Creating
                a load balancer allowed for the authentication API to have a static IP address at which it
                could be
                accessed via the public internet.

            <li>
                It is worth noting that Docker Compose does not allow for building images stored on a local
                machine,
                rather the images specified in <code>docker-compose.yml</code> must be pulled from a
                container
                repository.
            </li>
            <li>
                This is why the field <code>x-aws-pull_credentials</code> has been defined.
            </li>
            <li>
                The <code>networks</code> block defines how the two services will interface with each other.
            </li>
            <li>
                <code>sg-01af30133ec33c737</code> specifies a security group that governs the load balancer
                and the
                services defined in this file.
            </li>

    <p>
        Having pushed our container images to a remote repository and completed our
        <code>docker-compose.yml</code>
        file, we now need only to configure an AWS context for Docker and then run
        <code>docker compose up</code> and

            <li>
                If the JSON response is <code>true</code>, the authentication attempt succeeds.
            </li>
            <li>
                It was necessary to use the <code>requests</code> library in Python to form an appropriate
                request
                to the endpoint containing the username and password provided by the client.

                The <code>upload</code> endpoint in our main project API demonstrates how the authentication
                service will be used.
            </li>
            <li>
                In addition to a file parameter, a client must also provide their username and password.
            </li>
            <li>
                The values of the provided username and password will be used to either return a successful
                authentication response and execute the file upload or else display a message informing the
                client that their credentials are invalid.

        What I've learned
    </h3>
    <div class="col-md-12">
        <p>
            APIs and microservices are a fundamental topic in contemporary computing. The practical
            experience gained
            in learning how to provision and utilize cloud infrastructure has been extremely valuable. Prior
            to this course I
            was familiar with AWS and even realized that a large portion of the internet was hosted on AWS
            infrastructure, but
            I did not appreciate the complexity and breadth of services offered by AWS and the precision
            required
            to integrate multiple services with each other. For instance, this project made use of Amazon S3
            to store
            client-uploaded images, EC2 or ECS to deploy them, load balancers to handle network traffic and
            Route 53
            for resolving DNS requests to our static IP address. The majority of the orchestration between
            these resources
            was performed automatically, but in order to write the configuration files necessary to
            kickstart this
            orchestration, it was neceassary to research these services in depth.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is also worth noting that AWS is only one cloud solution provider;
            <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/">Microsoft Azure</a> and
            <a href="https://cloud.google.com/">Google Cloud Platform</a> are well-established competitors.
            Regardless
            of a cloud solution provider, the usage of Docker seems essential when developing, testing and
            deploying
            cloud-based applications. This project provided me with a much greater appreciation for what
            Docker and
            containerized applications can accomplish, both in respect to cloud-based applications and also
            applications
            intended to run locally.
        </p>
        <p>
            Prior to this project, I did not have a clear understanding of what an API was or how one was
            implemented.
            In a connected world increasingly supported by different software applications, APIs are crucial
            in
            providing a way for exchanging information between applications and providing useful services to
            consumers.
            I am delighted to have found an API framework as intuitive and easy to test as FastAPI. The
            image below
            demonstrates the API specific documentation that makes FastAPI so wonderful to work with:
