        <h3>Cloud Computing</h3>
        <p>
            As part of a graduate course in cloud computing, I worked with a group to develop a container testing service.
            Many organizations host their web applications using containers (see below) that run on cloud infrastructure.
            Our group determined that a service allowing organizations to test their containerized applications in a
            simulated cloud-based production environment would be met with enthusiasm. The service we would implement
            would allow our clients to upload a container image to our infrastructure. Our service would then provision
            the necessary resources to deploy and test this container. Almost immediately, we recognized that
            providing such a service entailed exposing our infrastructure to abuse by malicious actors. For example
            it would be trivial to upload a container intended to misuse our cloud infrastructure for the purpose of
            mining cryptocurrency, or to provision web hosting services in order to facilitate illegal
            activity. We determined it would be necessary to thoroughly vet our clients and also to require them to
            register an account with us before using our service. My contribution to this project was to create an
            authentication <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microservices">microservice</a> that would be used to
            authenticate our clients before they could access our service.

        <h3>What is an API? What are containers?</h3>
        <p>
            Generally speaking, an API is a software intermediary that allows two applications to talk to each other.
            For example, if you are using your phone and want to access a YouTube video, your phone will communicate with
            the YouTube servers using an intermediary API that takes your phone’s request, retrieves the data from
            YouTube’s servers and returns it to your device.
            An API also adds a layer of security by ensuring that the two devices only access each other through a
            predefined intermediary. However, APIs can actually be security flaws if the access to the API is not
            properly controlled and have been for websites such as Facebook.
            Modern APIs often rely on standards (such as HTTP or REST), which are friendly to developers and widely
            understood.
        </p>
        <p>
            The functional unit of an API is known as an <i>endpoint</i>. Endpoints can be implemented to perform specific
            functions. Imagine an API that is contacted in order to retrieve up-to-date weather information.
            One endpoint may return JSON data describing a weather forecast and another endpoint may return current weather
            information. Most APIs are contacted via the public internet, and in such cases, the API is accessed
            at its <i>base url</i>. For example, the United States National Weather Service provides a free and
            public API providing weather information at the base address <a href="https://api.weather.gov">https://api.weather.gov</a>.
            Navigating to this link in a web browser, or requesting the page via cURL or similar command line tool, will
            return a message informing the API consumer of the APIs status. Specific endpoints can be accessed by
            appending to the <i>base url</i>. For example, <a href="https://api.weather.gov/alerts">https://api.weather.gov/alerts</a>
             returns a list of all current weather alerts in the United States.
        </p>
        <p>
            Frequently, APIs
            are run in <a href="https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container/">Docker containers</a>, which allows them to
            be highly portable (able to operate on a wide variety of infrastructure across various operating systems) and
            also highly efficient (operate on as little computing resources as possible). A developer is able to write
            a recipe describing a particular container using a <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/">dockerfile</a>.
            The example below demonstrates the specification necessary to run an API accessing Amazon Web Services (AWS)
            resources. This dockerfile will be used to house the API examined in depth on this page:

            that allows cloud developers to provision infrastructure using machine and human readable files
            written in a declarative syntax. The code below demonstrates how this is done and assumes that both
            the Terraform and Amazon Web Services CLI have been installed on a local computer:

                <li>

                <li>
                    Of note is the <code>hash_key</code>, attribute which sets the primary key for the table to a client's

                    New columns will be automatically created when objects containing such fields are inserted into the table

                <li>
                    <code>tags</code> can be useful when a Terraform configuration file contains a large quantity

        <h3>Developing a back-end authentication API</h3>
        <p>
            I have used <a href="https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/">FastAPI</a> to implement the back-end logic required
            for performing authentication. I've chosen FastAPI over competing API frameworks because I was very impressed
            with the documentation provided by FastAPI. Not only were the getting started tutorials on their website
            excellent, but within the API itself one can navigate to a built-in <code>/docs</code> endpoint and
            interact with the various endpoints contained within the API (this will be demonstrated below). Let's take a
            look at our API implementation; it is very straightforward:

                    using the previously-stored salt, and if the resulting hash matches the stored hash, the password
                    can be considered correct.

                <li>
                    The <code>authenticate_no_form</code> endpoint is used to interface directly between the main
                    project's API (responsible for provisioning cloud infrastructure and deploying client-provided
                    images) and expects to receive a username and password value as <code>string</code>
                    types.
                </li>
                <li>
                    This function contains identical logic as explained above, only the argument types differ.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Finally, a <a href="https://www.uvicorn.org/">Uvicorn</a> server is started that runs the API
                    we have just implemented using a specified host and port.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        This API can now be loaded onto a docker container for portable deployment. The dockerfile responsible for
        doing so is featured at the top of this page.

    <h3>Creating a front-end registration form</h3>
    <div class="row">
        <p>
            Next, a registration form needs to be created that will allow clients to register for an account with our
            service and provide their preferred credentials. This form is simple and consists of basic HTML and
            <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> CSS. Bootstrap is used because it provides
            convenient form classes that validate field entries before the form is submitted, and this
            eliminates edge cases where a client may submit a null username or password value. Note that the API
            has been taken offline to avoid incurring unexpected costs on AWS, and the buttons <code>Authenticate</code>
            and <code>Register</code> now post the form field data to a public DNS resolver, so please do not
            enter any sensitive information.

    <h3>Deploying with Docker and Amazon ECS</h3>
    <p>
        We have successfully implemented all the individual components of our microservice, and testing has confirmed
        that everything is working as expected. Now it is time to deploy our microservice to cloud infrastructure,
        where our clients and the main project API can access it via the public internet. For this, I decided to use
        <a href="https://docs.docker.com/cloud/ecs-integration/">Docker Compose and ECS</a>. Docker Compose allows
        multiple containers to be configured and also provides the ability to define components shared between them.
        Amazon's
        <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/">Elastic Container Service</a> (ECS) is a container orchestration
        service that makes it easy to deploy, manage and scale containerized applications.
        <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/">Amazon Cloud Formation</a> is similar to Terraform in that
        it uses a declarative file to provision cloud infrastructure. The <code>docker-compose.yml</code> file
        shown below will be converted into an Amazon Cloud Formation template in order to provision the additional
        resources needed to deploy and interface the two containers described:
    </p>
    <div class="col-md-6">
        <pre>
            <code>
version: "3.8"

                <a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/">Docker Compose</a>
                allows for <code>x-aws</code> fields to be declared which correspond to AWS resources.
            </li>
            <li>
                <code>x-aws-loadbalancer</code> is declared here but was provisioned manually via the AWS console. Creating
                a load balancer allowed for the authentication API to have a static IP address at which it could be
                accessed via the public internet.
            </li>
            <li>
                The <code>services</code> block allows for the containerized applications defined in previous
                dockerfiles to be built and defines port mapping.
            </li>
            <li>
                It is worth noting that Docker Compose does not allow for building images stored on a local machine,
                rather the images specified in <code>docker-compose.yml</code> must be pulled from a container
                repository.
            </li>
            <li>
                This is why the field <code>x-aws-pull_credentials</code> has been defined.
            </li>
            <li>
                The <code>networks</code> block defines how the two services will interface with each other.
            </li>
            <li>
                <code>sg-01af30133ec33c737</code> specifies a security group that governs the load balancer and the
                services defined in this file.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <p>
        Having pushed our container images to a remote repository and completed our <code>docker-compose.yml</code>
        file, we now need only to configure an AWS context for Docker and then run <code>docker compose up</code> and
        our containerized applications and all required resources will be provisioned.

        <h3>Integrating the authentication microservice with the main project API</h3>
        <p>
            Now that our authentication microservice is up and running, we can request our clients register for an
            account and provide these credentials before using our services. Integrating the authentication
            microservice was fairly straightforward and is described below:
        </p>
        <div class="col-md-6">

                <li>
                    If the JSON response is <code>true</code>, the authentication attempt succeeds.

                <li>
                    It was necessary to use the <code>requests</code> library in Python to form an appropriate request

                    In addition to a file parameter, a client must also provide their username and password.

                    The values of the provided username and password will be used to either return a successful

            What I've learned
        </h3>
        <div class="col-md-12">
        <p>
            APIs and microservices are a fundamental topic in contemporary computing. The practical experience gained
            in learning how to provision and utilize cloud infrastructure has been extremely valuable. Prior to this course I
            was familiar with AWS and even realized that a large portion of the internet was hosted on AWS infrastructure, but
            I did not appreciate the complexity and breadth of services offered by AWS and the precision required
            to integrate multiple services with each other. For instance, this project made use of Amazon S3 to store
            client-uploaded images, EC2 or ECS to deploy them, load balancers to handle network traffic and Route 53
            for resolving DNS requests to our static IP address. The majority of the orchestration between these resources
            was performed automatically, but in order to write the configuration files necessary to kickstart this
            orchestration, it was neceassary to research these services in depth.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is also worth noting that AWS is only one cloud solution provider;
            <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/">Microsoft Azure</a> and
            <a href="https://cloud.google.com/">Google Cloud Platform</a> are well-established competitors. Regardless
            of a cloud solution provider, the usage of Docker seems essential when developing, testing and deploying
            cloud-based applications. This project provided me with a much greater appreciation for what Docker and
            containerized applications can accomplish, both in respect to cloud-based applications and also applications
            intended to run locally.
        </p>
        <p>
            Prior to this project, I did not have a clear understanding of what an API was or how one was implemented.
            In a connected world increasingly supported by different software applications, APIs are crucial in
            providing a way for exchanging information between applications and providing useful services to consumers.
            I am delighted to have found an API framework as intuitive and easy to test as FastAPI. The image below
            demonstrates the API specific documentation that makes FastAPI so wonderful to work with:
            <br>
